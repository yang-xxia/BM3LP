# 🏗️ BM3LP

**Bridge Maintenance Multimodal Link Prediction (BM3LP)** via spatiotemporal feature fusion and cross-modal contrastive interaction.

## 🔍 Overview

The BM3LP (Bridge Maintenance Multimodal Link Prediction) model aims to tackle the inconsistency across image modalities, as well as the challenges in expressing and reasoning spatiotemporal characteristics of bridge defects. By incorporating both image and text modalities, the model integrates spatiotemporal semantic information to provide an accurate understanding of defects, ultimately contributing to more effective treatment decision-making in bridge maintenance.

- 📷 **Graph Structure Encoder**: Uses DFS and RGAT to capture multi-hop dependencies between defect and structural data, overcoming limitations in long-range hierarchical modeling.
- 🌐 **Spatiotemporal Feature Modeling**: Combines CLIP and ST-GAT to jointly model image and text modalities, generating virtual embeddings to address missing image data and enhance spatiotemporal evolution.  
- 🔁 **cross-modal contrastive interaction**: Applies a progressive cross-modal contrast interaction strategy to improve feature retention, modality similarity, and cross-modal semantic association, addressing issues like feature forgetting and modality imbalance.  
- 🧠 **MMKG & Link Prediction**: Constructs a Bridge Maintenance MMKG and BriM dataset, demonstrating model advantages through multiple comparative experiments.

## 📥 Backbone Model: MambaVision-B-1K

The proposed **MKGM** model adopts **[MambaVision-B-1K](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/MambaVision-B-1K)** as the image feature extraction backbone.  
This pretrained model can be easily downloaded and used via [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co) or the `timm` library.

```python
from timm import create_model
model = create_model('mambavision_b_1k', pretrained=True)
