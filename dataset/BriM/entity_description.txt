0	A beam bridge is a common type of bridge whose main structure consists of horizontal beams that support the loads passing over the bridge. These beams are typically made of concrete, steel, or wood and are fixed at both ends to bridge piers or abutments. The design of beam bridges is simple, making them suitable for short spans, and they are commonly used for roads and railways. Their advantages include quick construction, easy maintenance, and lower costs.
1	The bridge deck system refers to the superstructure of the bridge that primarily supports the loads of vehicles and pedestrians. It is usually made of concrete or steel plates and is connected to the beams of the bridge. The bridge deck system must not only bear traffic loads but also address water-proofing, drainage, and anti-skid performance. Modern bridge deck systems may also include pre-stressed concrete slabs to enhance their load-bearing capacity and durability.
2	Bridge deck pavement refers to the layer of material applied to the surface of the bridge deck system, designed to provide a smooth driving surface and prevent wear. Common materials for pavement include asphalt and concrete. The pavement must consider durability and skid resistance, as well as adhesion to the bridge deck system to prevent detachment or cracking. Additionally, bridge deck pavement needs to manage drainage issues to avoid water accumulation that could cause damage.
3	Cracks in bridge deck pavement are a common problem in bridge maintenance, caused by various factors including temperature changes, traffic loads, material fatigue, and construction defects. The presence of cracks can affect the safety and comfort of the bridge deck, potentially leading to water infiltration and further structural damage. Regular inspection and maintenance are crucial to prevent the expansion of cracks, typically involving crack filling, resurfacing, or reinforcement treatments.
4	(1) Insufficient density of joint grouting concrete in hollow slabs. (2) Insufficient stiffness of connections between adjacent slabs. (3) Stress due to restrained shrinkage. (4) Tension deformation from thermal expansion and contraction. (5) Fatigue cracking caused by vehicle loads. (6) Construction joints not promptly treated. (7) Insufficient deck pavement thickness.
5	(1) Cracks reduce transverse stiffness, cause uneven load distribution, and lower load-carrying capacity. (2) Cracks allow water ingress, corrode main beams, and reduce durability. (3) Crack expansion leads to localized potholes.
6	(1) Clean beam tops thoroughly and ensure good quality of reinforcement binding. (2) Strictly control the quality of reinforcement mesh installation. (3) Minimize cold joints between the pavement layer and beam slabs. (4) Enhance control of concrete construction. (5) Conduct proper curing.
7	Crack injection and sealing.
8	(1) Asphalt. (2) Epoxy mortar.
9	(1) Bridge decks should be regularly cleaned to remove standing water, soil, debris, snow, and ice, maintaining a smooth and clean surface. (2) For asphalt concrete bridge decks with issues such as oil bleeding, heaving, cracking, waviness, potholes, or ruts, timely repairs should be carried out. Depending on the extent of damage, localized repair or full-span milling and relaying of the deck surface should be conducted, in compliance with the technical requirements of the current Technical Specifications for Maintenance of Highway Asphalt Pavements (JTG 5142). (3) For cement concrete bridge decks with issues such as cracking, heaving, faulting, scaling, or exposed aggregate, timely repairs should be carried out. Depending on the extent of damage, the existing deck surface should be removed entirely or in sections and relaid, in compliance with the technical requirements of the current Technical Specifications for Maintenance of Highway Cement Concrete Pavements (JTJ 073.1).
